      <h2>A Passion for Flavor</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Batman, the founder and owner of Hot Wings. My passion for creating delicious and flavorful wings started at a young age, growing up in Gotham where my parents died and I decided to start making wings. 
        Over the years, I've honed my skills and experimented with different flavors, eventually leading me to create the unique and mouthwatering wings we offer here at Hot Wings. 
        I'm dedicated to using fresh, high-quality ingredients and providing a welcoming atmosphere for our customers. It brings me immense joy to see people enjoying our food and creating lasting memories with friends and family at Hot Wings.
